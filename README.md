# Keras-RNN-for-TimeSeries-Forecasting-of-USA-Car-Mileage
Keras RNN used for forecasting time series data of USA car mileage.

The data was downloaded from: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TRFVOLUSM227NFWA

        - The data is based on the number of miles driven within the                                       
          United States each year
        - The data is collected in a monthly interval
        
**The goal of this project is to forecast how many miles will be driven within the United States over the course of the next 2 years using a RNN.**

**The steps of this process include**

**1.)** Import Libraries 

**2.)** Import CSV Data

**3.)** Visualize/Explore Data

**4.)** Train Test Split

**5.)** Scale Data

**6.)** Time Series Generator

**7.)** Create RNN Model

**8.)** Plot and Visualize Model Performance

**9.)** Evaluate Model on Test Data

**10.)** Inverse Transform Data

**11.)** Visualize and Compare Predictions vs Test Set

**12.)** Observations

**13.)** Save Model
